# WorkInProgress - My (C.Nicklin) photography portfolio.

I'm building this project to exercise what I have thus far learned in my Codecademy Full Stack Engineer course, in particular React/Redux. It's a work in progress and I'll up this readme as I finish features. Certain features, such as 'request prints', are being added for me to exercise in e.g. APIs and aren't intended to be used. i.e. I don't plan to sell prints!

Technologies used:
HTML
CSS
JS - React/Redux/vanilla.js
React - 
 This site is built using redux-toolkit and associated libraries.
  CreateSlice, createStore, Router, useSelector, useDispatch, createAsyncThunk, Provider etc.

You'll find a few routes which are empty - these are in place as reminders of additional components to build etc.
