# WorkInProgress - My (C.Nicklin) photography portfolio.

Primarily, I'm building this project as an exercise in React/Redux state and CSS is low priority in this case. It's a work in progress and I'll up this readme when it's finished! Certain features, such as 'request prints', are being added for me to exercise in e.g. APIs and aren't intended to be used. i.e. I don't plan to sell prints!

You'll find a few files which are empty - these are in place as reminders of additional components to build etc.
